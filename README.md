## üéÆ Game Description

Pixel Walker: Night Adventure v2 is a side-scrolling platformer game set against a mystical night-time backdrop. Players control a pixelated character who must navigate a treacherous world filled with various obstacles. The goal is to run as far as possible, jumping over spikes, avoiding hungry Eaters, timing leaps across permanent gaps and onto tricky blinking platforms. The world scrolls dynamically as the player moves forward.

## üöÄ How to Play

The game is controlled using either keyboard inputs or on-screen touch/mouse buttons.

### Objective:

* Navigate the player character through the world by moving right.

* Score points by successfully passing obstacles. The further you go, the higher your score.
* The game ends if the player collides with an obstacle or falls into a gap.

## üëæ Obstacles

Players will encounter several types of obstacles:

1.  **Spikes:** Sharp, glowing red spikes that must be jumped over. Touching them results in a game over.
2.  **Gaps:** Permanent chasms in the ground. Falling into a gap means game over.
3.  **Eaters:** Yellow, circular creatures with a chomping mouth.
    * They move back and forth within a defined range.
    * Their mouth faces the direction they are currently moving.
    * Contact with an Eater results in a game over.
4.  **Blinking Ground Platforms:** These platforms alternate between being solid and being a gap.
    * When solid, they have a distinct purple-ish color with a light border and are safe to stand on.
    * When they are not solid, they act as a gap, and the player will fall through.
    * Players must time their jumps carefully to land on them when they are solid. These platforms are significantly longer than other obstacles, requiring sustained attention.
